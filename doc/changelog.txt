Version 1.1
Updated: 7/5/2013
========

1) Added extended directives:
--- INCBIN <string>: Embed a binary file inside the assembled binary (requires that the file be word aligned)
--- INCLUDE <string>: Include another assembly file
--- RESERVE <integer>: Reserve a contiguous block of words inside the assembled binary (initialized to zero)

2) Fixed a bug where the build path was not being set to the current location of 
the input file. As a result, all include directives required absolute paths, 
or ralative paths to the assembler.
